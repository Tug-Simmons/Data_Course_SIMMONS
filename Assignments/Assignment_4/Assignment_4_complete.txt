Create a plaintext document named “final_project_idea.txt”

In it, describe your idea for a data analysis final project

The project will be a species diversity and species distribution of the reptiles and amphibians found on the camp williams military base range from the years of 2019-2023,
as well as any other relevant weight/length information found for species where the data has enough entries relevant to the species to plot.
This will be a herpetological ecology survey and the information found from it.

Also, Describe the sort of data you will use, potential sources, and what the data might look like

I will be using herpetological data collected by the natural resources division of the camp williams national guard.

(If you already have data, skip this task) Create fake data that simulates what your final project data set might look like. Preferrably a csv file

Generate a plot (using ggplot) using either your real or fake data that shows at least one expected result
(found in folder alongside this document)
